/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for User Profiles and related data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Each user can only
 * read and write their own profile data.  Listing all users is explicitly
 * forbidden. Data shapes are not strictly validated in this prototype to allow
 * for flexible schema changes, except where necessary for maintaining
 * authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores public user profile information. The `userId` in
 *   the path MUST match the `uid` property within the document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent enumeration attacks.
 * - All write operations require a verified, signed-in user.
 * - Data validation is minimal during this prototyping phase, focusing on
 *   ownership and relational integrity rather than comprehensive schema checks.
 * - Denormalization: The `uid` is duplicated both as the document ID and as a
 *   field within the document for simpler rule enforcement.
